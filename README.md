# BellyButton

## Overview


The objective of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Diversity dataset which catalogs the microbes colonizing human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
