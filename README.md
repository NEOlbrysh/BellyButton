# BellyButton

## Overview
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
### What You're Creating
This assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:
-	Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
-	Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
-	Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
-	Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

### Objective
The objective of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Diversity dataset which catalogs the microbes colonizing human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. 


- Dropdown to examine data from all participants 




- Bar chart featuring the top ten microbial species (OTUs or operational taxonomic units)




- Bubble chart featuring all microbial species




- Gauge of the frequency of belly button washes weekly for each participant
