# BellyButton

## Overview


The objective of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Diversity dataset which catalogs the microbes colonizing human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. 


- Dropdown to examine data from all participants 




- Bar chart featuring the top ten microbial species (OTUs or operational taxonomic units)




- Bubble chart featuring all microbial species




- Gauge of the frequency of belly button washes weekly for each participant
